## Task 1 - Identify the 2 errors in the code:


1. App.js -
  right on launching the "npm start" command on terminal this warning is being shown:
    "src/App.js
      Line 14:9:  'handleFavorite' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars"
   in order to fix it, i corrected this line of code inside the App.js file by adding: "onFavoriteToggle={handleFavorite}" to it.

2. MovieItem.js -
  While running the program on the local server i noticed that pressing the buttons of the movies doesnt make any effect.
   in order to fix this problem, inside the file MovieItem.js i changed the button element- onMovieSelect(movie) (add "movie" inside the brackets) so the button will have his funcionality
